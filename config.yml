# DENIZENS are helpful, interactive Citizens!  Denizens run off of mini scripts with steps and events.  They can be used in hundreds
# of different ways, from tutorials, to questing, to administrating and more!

# Timeline: Beta 1 -- All functionality used in this example file.
#           Beta 2 -- Complete functionality of additional behaviors/requirements/triggers listed.
#           1.0 -- Bug fixes from Beta.
#           1.5 -- In-game Script editor.
